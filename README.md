Technology is my passion, and I am dedicated to writing clean, efficient, and well-structured code. I strongly believe in maintainability and scalability, which is why I follow established design patterns and keep my codebase highly organized. My expertise lies primarily in back-end development, where I leverage Laravel and Symfony to build robust applications, as PHP is my main programming language.

I specialize in designing and managing databases, ensuring optimal data integrity and performance. Additionally, I focus on building and exposing data through RESTful and GraphQL APIs, as I often work on headless applications that require seamless communication between front-end and back-end systems. My goal is to create efficient, scalable, and maintainable solutions that drive high-quality software development.
